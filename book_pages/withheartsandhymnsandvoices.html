    				<p>A sparkling novel about the BBC 'Songs of Praise' team recording a Palm Sunday broadcast from a small idyllic Suffolk village. As the outside broadcast vehicles roll in, ambitions and emotions run high. Producer Jan Harding finds the vicar, Clive Linton, hopelessly absent-minded. His practical wife Helen gets on well with the television team - perhaps a little too well, where the charming, enigmatic Michael is concerned. Charles, the Parish Council chairman, is deeply opposed and resents the enthusiasm of other villagers - including his wife Betty. Bunty Maddocks, queen of every local committee, plots to get round the ban on church flowers during Lent; retired accountant Jack Diggens finds purpose, faith and friendship as he plans tickets and seating; and teenage soloist Anna surprises herself with her success. This delightful story will make you laugh and cry.</p>
