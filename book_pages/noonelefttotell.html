    				<p>New York Times bestselling author Karen Rose returns to the gritty world of Baltimore's cops and prosecutors with a tale of danger and desire that will leave you breathless...

A car crashes in front of rookie PI Paige Holden's home. And suddenly, she finds one of her pro bono clients dying in her arms--from a gunshot wound. With her last breath, the woman whispers cryptic words into her ear and hands her a blood-smeared flash drive. Five years ago, State's Attorney Grayson Smith put a murderer behind bars. But when Paige Holden shares the flash drive with him, its contents cast doubts on the conviction--and lead him and Paige into a world of blackmail, dark secrets, and a decades-long string of murders. An investigation they'll survive only by trusting each other--and the truth.</p>
