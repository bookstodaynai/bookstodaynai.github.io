    				<h2>The Wolf And The Raven</h2>
    				<h3>Diana L. Paxson</h3>
    				<h3>Price: Ksh. 100</h3>
    				<p>It is the fifth century, and the Germanic tribes are pushing westward toward the world of Rome. In the forest of the Teutons, Sigfrid works at the forge and runs with the wolves. In the Taunus mountains, Brunhild trains with the Walkyriun, the witch-warriors who serve the tribes. Both find a father in Wodan, the ambiguous god of magic and madness who is guiding the tribes into a new world. Wodan helps Sigfrid forge a legendary sword and become a hero. With his guidance, Brunhild becomes a raven priestess. But Sigfrid's first great deed leaves him without a family, and when Brunhild obeys the god instead of her superiors, she is cast out. Their only hope of happiness lies together, but more than their own lives will be changed when the wolf and the raven fall in love . . .</p>
