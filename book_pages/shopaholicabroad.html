    				<p>For Rebecca Bloomwood, life is peachy. She has a job on morning TV, her bank manager is actually being nice to her, and when it comes to spending money, her new motto is Buy Only What You Need - and she's really (sort of) sticking to it. The icing on the brioche is that she's been offered a chance to work in New York. New York! The Museum of Modern Art! The Guggenheim! The Metropolitan Opera House! And Becky does mean to go to them all. Honestly. It's just that it seems silly not to check out a few other famous places first. Like Saks. And Bloomingdales. And Barneys. And one of those fantastic sample sales where you can get a Prada dress for $10. Or was it $100? Anyway, it's full of amazing bargains. Everybody loves Sophie Kinsella: "I almost cried with laughter." (Daily Mail). "Hilarious ...you'll laugh and gasp on every page." (Jenny Colgan). "Properly mood-altering ...funny, fast and farcical. I loved it." (Jojo Moyes). "A superb tale. Five stars!" (Heat).</p>
