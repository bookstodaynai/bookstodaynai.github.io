    				<p>The Stone Of Light The Place Of Truth</p>
    				<p>Christian Jacq</p>
                                <p>Condition: Second Hand</p>
    				<h3>Price: Ksh. 200</h3>
    				<p>Nefer the Silent and Paneb the Ardent can relax and carry out the work they were born to do, create materpieces for the eternal glorification of the Pharaohs. But Mehy is obsessed with the Stone of Light and his craving for power has not abated, nor his vindictiveness against the Place of Truth.</p>
