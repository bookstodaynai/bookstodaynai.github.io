    				<p>Journalist Kitty Logans career is being destroyed by scandal - and now she faces losing the woman who guided and taught her everything she knew. At her terminally ill friends bedside, Kitty asks - what is the one story she always wanted to write?The answer lies in a file buried in Constances office: a list of one hundred names. There is no synopsis, nothing to explain what the story is or who these people are. The list is simply a mystery. But before Kitty can talk to her friend, it is too late.With everything to prove, Kitty is assigned the most important task of her life: to write the story her mentor never had the opportunity to. Kitty not only has to track down and meet the people on the list, but find out what connects them. And, in the process of hearing ordinary peoples stories, she starts to understand her own.</p>
