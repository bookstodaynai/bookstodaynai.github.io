            <h2>On The Black Hill</h2>
            <h3>Bruce Chatwin</h3>
            <h3>Price: Ksh. 100</h3>
            <p>On the Black Hill is an elegantly written tale of identical twin brothers who grow up on a farm in rural Wales and never leave home. They till the rough soil and sleep in the same bed, touched only occasionally by the advances of the twentieth century.

In depicting the lives of Benjamin and Lewis and their interactions with their small local community Chatwin comments movingly on the larger questions of human experience.</p>
