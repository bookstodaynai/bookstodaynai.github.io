'When you have experienced Sons and Lovers you have lived through the agonies of the young Lawrence striving to win free from his old life'.

Richard Aldington
This novel is Lawrence's semi-autobiographical masterpiece in which he explores emotional conflicts through the protagonist, Paul Morel, and his suffocating relationships with a demanding mother and two very different lovers.
