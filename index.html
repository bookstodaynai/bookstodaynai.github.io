This website enables you to search for second hand novels
from book vendors located in town , so that you no longer
have to stand and make educated guess of the book that you
would like.

For now we have partnered up with Kevin , a second hand book
vendor located at Moi Avenue , KTDA , infront of family bank

The process is simple , browse his current catalogue using 
this website, finding more infomation about the book by
clicking on the book. Then go pick the book from him
